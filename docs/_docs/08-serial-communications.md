## Overview

The MXChip IoT DevKit has two UART serial ports. One is connected to the USB port and allows you to send serial data over a USB cable, such as debugging information. The other is available from Pins 1 and 2 on the finger connector and allows you to connect the device to other modules that send data over serial.

## Sending data over the USB serial port

The USB serial port is available using the `Serial` global variable, and this uses the `UART_0` serial port. The API for this is identical to the standard Arduino `Serial` API, which you can read about in the [Arduino Serial communication docs](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial/).

```c
// Open the serial port at a speed of 115200 baud
Serial.begin(115200);

// Send a message over the serial connection
Serial.write("Hello");
```

You can monitor data sent over this serial connection using the VS Code Serial Monitor, available from the command palette by selecting *Arduino: Open Serial Monitor*. The board will send logging information over this port in addition to the data you send.

## Sending data over the finger connector serial port

The second UART serial port is available via the finger connector on the large pins 1 and 2.

![The MXChip finger connector with pin 1 marked as TX and pin 2 marked as RX]({{"/assets/images/how-to/serial/board_annotated_pins.png" | absolute_url }})

| Pin | Usage         |
| --- | ------------- |
| 1   | TX - Transmit |
| 2   | RX - Receive  |

Pin 1 is the transmit (TX) pin, and is used to send serial data to an external module. This pin should connect to the **RX** pin on the external module.

Pin 2 is the receive (RX) pin, and is used to receive serial data from an external module. This pin should connect to the **TX** pin on the external module.

> NOTE: The TX pin on the MXChip IoT DevKit needs to connect to the RX pin on an external module, and vice versa. The signal transmitted needs to go to a receiving pin.

Once the device is connected, you will need to declare a new `UARTClass` variable pointing to the second serial port, `UART_1`.

```c
UARTClass Serial1(UART_1);
```

This has the same type as the `Serial` global variable, and uses the same serial API.

```c
// Open the serial port at a speed of 9600 baud
Serial.begin(9600);

// Read a byte from the second serial port
int byte = Serial1.read();

// Send the byte to the USB serial port for debugging
Serial.write(byte);
```
